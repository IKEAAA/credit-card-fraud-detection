# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project is a Machine Learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to build a system that helps financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent activities using data-driven techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using supervised learning algorithms
- Evaluation of model performance
- Deployment-ready fraud detection pipeline

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project contains transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
- Features include transaction amount, time, and anonymized attributes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IKEAAA/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results
- The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.
- Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are analyzed to evaluate the model.

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy.
- Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model as an API for real-time fraud detection.
